# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for debugging and fixing critical issues in the MindLyfe mental health platform. The platform currently has multiple issues preventing users from successfully registering, signing up, accessing the dashboard, and matching with therapists. This comprehensive fix will ensure a smooth user experience from registration through to accessing core platform features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication System Debugging

**User Story:** As a user (individual, therapist, or organization), I want to successfully register and sign in to the platform, so that I can access the mental health services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to register with valid information THEN the system SHALL create a profile successfully and return appropriate authentication tokens
2. WHEN a user attempts to sign in with valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them and redirect to the dashboard
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the specific issue
4. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL handle token refresh automatically or prompt for re-authentication
5. IF the backend API is unreachable THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 2: Registration Flow Completion

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to complete the registration process for my specific role (individual, therapist, organization), so that I can access role-appropriate features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an individual registers THEN the system SHALL create both a profile and individual_profile record
2. WHEN a therapist registers THEN the system SHALL create profile, therapist_profile records and handle document uploads
3. WHEN an organization registers THEN the system SHALL create profile and organization_profile records with proper validation
4. WHEN registration data is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific field-level validation errors
5. WHEN required documents are missing for therapists THEN the system SHALL prevent registration completion with clear messaging

### Requirement 3: Dashboard Access and Loading

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to access my dashboard immediately after login, so that I can view my personalized information and take actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their role-appropriate dashboard
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display user-specific data (sessions, messages, stats)
3. WHEN dashboard data is loading THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states
4. WHEN dashboard API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display error states with retry options
5. IF user data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL prompt for profile completion

### Requirement 4: Therapist Matching and Discovery

**User Story:** As an individual client, I want to find and match with qualified therapists based on my preferences, so that I can book therapy sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client searches for therapists THEN the system SHALL return verified therapists matching their criteria
2. WHEN filtering by specialization THEN the system SHALL show only therapists with those specific specializations
3. WHEN filtering by language THEN the system SHALL show therapists who speak the selected language
4. WHEN viewing therapist profiles THEN the system SHALL display complete professional information and availability
5. WHEN no therapists match criteria THEN the system SHALL suggest alternative options or broader search parameters

### Requirement 5: Session Booking and Management

**User Story:** As a client, I want to book therapy sessions with available therapists, so that I can receive mental health support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing therapist availability THEN the system SHALL show accurate real-time availability slots
2. WHEN booking a session THEN the system SHALL create the session record and send confirmations
3. WHEN a session is booked THEN the system SHALL update therapist availability automatically
4. WHEN booking conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL prevent double-booking with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN payment is required THEN the system SHALL integrate with payment processing before confirming the booking

### Requirement 6: Database Connection and API Reliability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to have reliable database connections and API responses, so that users have a consistent experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL establish stable database connections
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL respond within acceptable time limits (< 5 seconds)
3. WHEN database queries fail THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling and logging
4. WHEN connection pools are exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests appropriately
5. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL implement graceful degradation

### Requirement 7: Error Handling and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when errors occur, so that I understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display field-specific error messages
2. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages with retry options
3. WHEN server errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information while showing generic user messages
4. WHEN forms have errors THEN the system SHALL highlight problematic fields and prevent submission
5. WHEN operations succeed THEN the system SHALL provide positive confirmation feedback

### Requirement 8: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a user with a specific role, I want to access only the features and data appropriate for my role, so that the platform maintains security and relevance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an individual logs in THEN the system SHALL show client-specific dashboard and features
2. WHEN a therapist logs in THEN the system SHALL show therapist-specific tools and client management
3. WHEN an organization admin logs in THEN the system SHALL show organization management features
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL deny access with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN role verification fails THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate error or login pages
